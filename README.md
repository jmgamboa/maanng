# 🚀 DSA Patterns Curriculum 

👋  
I’ve always struggled with leetcode. With existing programs like Neetcode 150 or Blind 75, there is too much of a gap between an easy and a medium problem. This is why I developed a **progressive** curriculum: Easy problems that build upon another and lead into medium level difficulty and having the foundations to even tackle hard problems. I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me.

## 🎯 Goal
Learn LeetCode by mastering **core patterns** (not memorizing solutions), through:
- ✅ Structured **progression** (Easy → Easier Medium → Medium -> Hard)
- ✅ Repetition with variation (pattern recognition)
---

## 🧱 Prerequisites
You should be comfortable with:
- your programming language of choice
- loops, conditionals, built-in functions
- different O notations

---

## 🧩 Curriculum (Recommended Order)
- 🗂️ Arrays and Hashmaps
- 🔁 Two Pointers  
- 🧱 Stack (Monotonic + classic)  
- 🪟 Sliding Window  
- 🌳 Trees (DFS/BFS basics)  
- 🧺 Hashing & Frequency Maps  
- 🔍 Binary Search
- 🧵 Backtracking (subsets/permutations)  
- 🧠 Dynamic Programming

## 🏁 North Star
**Consistency beats intensity.**  
60 minutes/day adds up. 📈🔥
