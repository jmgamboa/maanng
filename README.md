# 🚀 LeetCode Patterns Curriculum (AI-Assisted)

Welcome! 👋  
I’ve always struggled with learning LeetCode. There was too much of a gap between an easy and a medium so I developed a **progressive** curriculum: Easy problems that build upon another and lead into easier mediums. At which point we reinforce the same patterns and solutions learned through different problems. I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me.

## 🎯 Goal
Learn LeetCode by mastering **core patterns** (not memorizing solutions), through:
- ✅ Structured **progression** (Easy → Easier Medium → Medium -> Hard)
- ✅ Repetition with variation (pattern recognition)
- ✅ Clear explanations + feedback loops 

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites
You should be comfortable with:
- Variables, loops, conditionals, functions

---

## 🧩 Patterns We’ll Master (Progressive)
- 🪟 Sliding Window  
- 🔁 Two Pointers  
- 🧺 Hashing & Frequency Maps  
- 🧱 Stack (Monotonic + classic)  
- 🌳 Trees (DFS/BFS basics)  
- 🔍 Binary Search (incl. “answer space”)  
- 🧵 Backtracking (subsets/permutations)  
- 🧠 Dynamic Programming (intro → common forms)

---

## 🧰 How I Use AI
AI is my **coach**, not my crutch:
- ✅ Ask for hints
- ✅ Ask to review my code + edge cases
- ✅ Ask for an explanation or visualization

**Consistency beats intensity.**  
Even 30–60 minutes/day adds up. 📈🔥
